    "### Main Ideas of Binary Search Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Binary Tree Structure\n",
    "   - Each node in a binary tree has at most two children: a left child and a right child.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Binary Search Property\n",
    "   - For any node with value $ N $:\n",
    "     - All values in its left subtree are less than $ N $.\n",
    "     - All values in its right subtree are greater than $ N $.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Operations\n",
    "   - **Search**: Given a value, determine if it exists in the tree. Start at the root and move left or right depending on whether the value is less than or greater than the current node.\n",
    "   - **Insertion**: Add a new value to the tree. Find the appropriate position by traversing the tree from the root and place the new node as a leaf.\n",
    "   - **Deletion**: Remove a value from the tree. There are three cases:\n",
    "     - The node to be deleted is a leaf.\n",
    "     - The node to be deleted has one child.\n",
    "     - The node to be deleted has two children. In this case, replace it with its in-order successor (the smallest value in its right subtree) or in-order predecessor (the largest value in its left subtree).\n"

    "In the provided implementation, methods with and without an underscore serve different purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Public Methods (without underscore)\n",
    "   - These methods are part of the public interface of the class. They are intended to be called directly by the user of the class. For example, `insert`, `search`, and `delete` methods are designed to be invoked by users of the `BinarySearchTree` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Helper Methods (with underscore)\n",
    "   - These methods are internal to the class and are not intended to be called directly by the user. They perform the actual recursive operations required for insertion, searching, and deletion. The underscore is a common convention in Python to indicate that these methods are intended to be private or internal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of This Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation**:\n",
    "   - The public methods provide a simplified interface to the user, abstracting away the details of recursion and node traversal.\n",
    "   - The helper methods handle the complexity of the operations, keeping the public methods clean and easy to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Separation of Concerns**:\n",
    "   - Public methods manage the setup and initial checks (like starting the operation from the root node).\n",
    "   - Helper methods perform the actual recursive work, ensuring that the operations are correctly applied throughout the tree structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Readability and Maintainability**:\n",
    "   - This separation makes the code easier to read and maintain. The public methods are straightforward and concise, while the recursive logic is contained within the helper methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures the Binary Search Tree implementation is clean, organized, and easy to use."

    "## AVL Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "These were the first self-balancing trees invented by the authors [G. M. Adelson-Velsky](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgy_Adelson-Velsky) and [E. M. Landis](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yevgeniy_Landis) in their paper \"[*An Algorithm for the Organization of Information*](https://zhjwpku.com/assets/pdf/AED2-10-avl-paper.pdf)\"\n",

    "An AVL tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree (BST) where the difference in heights between the left and right subtrees of any node (the balance factor) is at most one. This ensures that the tree remains approximately balanced, allowing for efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Example of an AVL Tree](../images/avl_tree_example.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Ideas of AVL Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Balance Factor\n",
    "   - The balance factor of a node is defined as the height difference between its left and right subtrees.\n",
    "   - For a node $ N $, Balance Factor = Height(Left Subtree) - Height(Right Subtree).\n",
    "   - In an AVL tree, the balance factor of each node must be -1, 0, or 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rotations\n",
    "   - To maintain the balance factor property after insertions or deletions, AVL trees perform rotations.\n",
    "   - There are four types of rotations used to rebalance the tree:\n",
    "     - **Left Rotation (LL)**: Used when a node becomes right-heavy.\n",
    "     - **Right Rotation (RR)**: Used when a node becomes left-heavy.\n",
    "     - **Left-Right Rotation (LR)**: Used when the left child of a node is right-heavy.\n",
    "     - **Right-Left Rotation (RL)**: Used when the right child of a node is left-heavy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Insertion\n",
    "   - Insertion in an AVL tree follows the same logic as a regular BST.\n",
    "   - After insertion, the tree is checked for balance from the inserted node up to the root.\n",
    "   - Rotations are performed as necessary to maintain the AVL property.\n",
    "#### Deletion\n",
    "   - Deletion also follows the logic of a regular BST.\n",
    "   - After deletion, the tree is checked for balance from the deleted node’s parent up to the root.\n",
    "   - Rotations are performed as necessary to maintain the AVL property.\n",
