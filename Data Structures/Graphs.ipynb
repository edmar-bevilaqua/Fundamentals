    "1. **Vertices (Nodes)**: The individual elements or points in a graph.\n",
    "2. **Edges (Links)**: The connections between pairs of vertices. Edges can be:\n",
    "   - **Directed**: The edge has a direction (e.g., from vertex A to vertex B).\n",
    "   - **Undirected**: The edge has no direction (e.g., a bidirectional link between vertices A and B).\n",
    "3. **Weighted vs. Unweighted**: \n",
    "   - **Weighted Graphs**: Edges have associated weights or costs.\n",
    "   - **Unweighted Graphs**: All edges are equal, without weights.\n",
    "4. **Adjacency List**: A way to represent a graph where each vertex stores a list of adjacent vertices.\n",
    "5. **Adjacency Matrix**: A 2D array where each cell (i, j) indicates if there's an edge from vertex `i` to vertex `j`.\n",

    "## Common Graph Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Traverses as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.\n",
    "2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n",
    "3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks."
