    "# Linked Lists\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how linked lists work, let's first use a brief metaphor:  \n",
    "* Imagine that you and 2 other friends decide to go to the movies, you bought 3 tickets, so you can all sit nearby. Let's suppose that the movie is very popular, and only a few seats were left unbought. If another friend decide to go at the last minute, you'll have to look for another row that seats 4 adjacent people. If a fifth friend appears, you'll all need to relocate to be able to sit close together again. What a stress!  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Similarly, this is how a simple array works: it allocates exactly the number of slots (seats) it needs. If any new data is added to the array, the whole set needs to be moved in memory so that the data remains adjacent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thats where the linked lists shine!"

    "A linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science, used for storing a sequence of elements. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nodes**: The basic unit of a linked list is a node. Each node contains:\n",
    "   - **Data**: The value or information the node holds.\n",
    "   - **Pointer**: A reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Head**: The first node in the linked list is called the head. It serves as the entry point to the list. If the list is empty, the head is `null` or `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tail**: The last node's pointer is set to `null` or `None`, indicating the end of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Linked Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Singly Linked List**: Each node has a single pointer to the next node.\n",
    "* **Doubly Linked List**: Each node has two pointers: one to the next node and another to the previous node, allowing traversal in both directions.\n",
    "* **Circular Linked List**: The last node points back to the first node, forming a circle. This can be applied to both singly and doubly linked lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Traversal**: Accessing each element in the list starting from the head and moving through each node until the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Insertion**:\n",
    "   - **At the beginning**: Create a new node and point it to the current head, then update the head to this new node.\n",
    "   - **At the end**: Traverse to the end of the list, create a new node, and update the last node's pointer to this new node.\n",
    "   - **At a specific position**: Traverse to the specified position, adjust pointers to insert the new node.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Deletion**:\n",
    "   - **From the beginning**: Update the head to point to the second node, effectively removing the first node.\n",
    "   - **From the end**: Traverse to the second-to-last node and set its pointer to `null` or `None`.\n",
    "   - **From a specific position**: Adjust pointers to bypass the node to be deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Searching**: Traverse the list and compare each node's data with the target value until a match is found or the end is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**:\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Size**: Linked lists can grow or shrink in size more easily than arrays, as elements can be added or removed without the need for resizing or moving other elements.\n",
    "2. **Efficient Insertions/Deletions**: Adding or removing elements, especially at the beginning or end, is generally faster than in arrays, as it requires only pointer adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages**:\n",
    "1. **Memory Overhead**: Each node requires additional memory for storing pointers.\n",
    "2. **Sequential Access**: Elements must be accessed sequentially from the head, making random access slower compared to arrays.\n",
    "3. **Complexity**: More complex to implement and manage, especially with multiple pointers (as in doubly linked lists) or special cases (like circular references).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Linked lists are used in various applications where dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertions/deletions are crucial, such as:\n",
    "- Implementing stacks and queues\n",
    "- Handling sparse matrices\n",
    "- Managing objects that frequently change in size or position (e.g., in games or simulations)\n",
    "- Creating adjacency lists for graph representations\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding linked lists is essential for grasping more complex data structures like trees, graphs, and more advanced lists (e.g., skip lists).  \n",
    "Below we will implement a simple linked list (each node points only to the next node) in Python!"

    "## Stacks\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a stack is a fundamental data structure based on the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition \n",
    "   - A stack is a collection of elements with two main operations: \n",
    "     - **Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.\n",
    "     - **Pop**: Removes and returns the top element of the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation\n",
    "   - Stacks can be implemented using various data structures in Python. The most straightforward way is to use a list since Python lists support append (to push) and pop (to pop) operations efficiently.\n",
    "   - Alternatively, you can implement a stack using a linked list for more control over the internals, but this is less common due to Python's list efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Operations\n",
    "   - **Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack. In Python, you can use the `append()` method of a list to push an element onto the stack.\n",
    "   - **Pop**: Removes and returns the top element of the stack. The `pop()` method of a list removes the last element by default, making it perfect for implementing stack behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accessing Stack Elements\n",
    "   - While stacks primarily support push and pop operations, you can also peek at the top element without removing it. In Python, accessing the last element of a list (`stack[-1]`) gives you the element at the top of the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Usage\n",
    "   - Stacks are used in scenarios where the last element added should be the first one to be removed, such as:\n",
    "     - Expression evaluation and syntax parsing (like in compilers).\n",
    "     - Depth-first search (DFS) algorithms.\n",
    "     - Undo mechanisms in applications.\n",
    "     - Handling function calls and recursion in programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, stacks in Python are simple yet powerful structures that facilitate efficient last-in, first-out operations. They leverage Python's list operations for ease of implementation and are widely used in both algorithmic problems and real-world applications for managing sequential data."
