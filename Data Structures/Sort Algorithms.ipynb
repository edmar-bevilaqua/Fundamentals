    "## Bubble Sort\n",
    "---\n",
    "Bubble sort is a simple and straightforward sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the list is sorted. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the main ideas behind bubble sort:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Ideas of Bubble Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comparison and Swap\n",
    "   - Compare each pair of adjacent elements.\n",
    "   - If the elements are in the wrong order (e.g., the first is greater than the second for ascending order), swap them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multiple Passes:\n",
    "   - The process of comparison and swapping is repeated for multiple passes.\n",
    "   - Each pass through the list places the next largest (or smallest, depending on the order) element in its correct position.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics of Bubble Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time Complexity\n",
    "  - Worst and average case: $O(n^2)$ (when the array is in reverse order).\n",
    "  - Best case: $O(n)$ (when the array is already sorted, with the optimized version).\n",
    "  - Bubble sort is generally not used for large datasets due to its inefficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Space Complexity\n",
    "  - $O(1)$ (in-place sorting).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stability\n",
    "  - Bubble sort is a stable sorting algorithm because it does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys."

    "Merge sort is a more advanced sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer paradigm. It divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the two sorted halves back together.\n",

    "   - Divide the unsorted list into two approximately equal halves.\n",

    "   - Merge the two sorted halves into a single sorted list.\n",

    "  - Merge sort has a time complexity of $O(n \\log n)$ in all cases (worst, average, and best).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Space Complexity:\n",
    "  - The space complexity is $O(n)$ because of the extra space used for the temporary arrays.\n",

    "## Quick Sort\n",
    "Quick Sort is a popular and efficient sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer strategy to sort elements. Here are the main ideas behind Quick Sort, along with a Python implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Divide-and-Conquer**: Quick Sort divides the array into subarrays and sorts each subarray independently.\n",
    "2. **Pivot Selection**: A pivot element is chosen from the array. The pivot can be any element, but common choices are the first element, the last element, the middle element, or a random element.\n",
    "3. **Partitioning**: The array is rearranged so that all elements less than the pivot come before it, and all elements greater than the pivot come after it. This places the pivot in its correct sorted position.\n",
    "4. **Recursion**: The same process is recursively applied to the subarrays formed by dividing the array at the pivot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps of Quick Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choose a Pivot**: Select an element from the array as the pivot.\n",
    "2. **Partition**: Rearrange the elements in the array so that elements less than the pivot are on the left, elements greater than the pivot are on the right.\n",
    "3. **Recursively Apply**: Apply the same process to the left and right subarrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a step-by-step Python implementation of Quick Sort:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def quick_sort(arr):\n",
    "    # Helper function to perform the partitioning\n",
    "    def partition(low, high):\n",
    "        pivot = arr[high]  # Choosing the last element as pivot\n",
    "        i = low - 1  # Index of smaller element\n",
    "        for j in range(low, high):\n",
    "            # If current element is smaller than or equal to pivot\n",

    "                arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]  # Swap\n",
    "        arr[i + 1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i + 1]  # Swap pivot element with element at i+1\n",

    "        if low < high:\n",
    "            # pi is partitioning index, arr[pi] is now at right place\n",

    "            quick_sort_recursive(pi + 1, high)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Call the recursive quicksort function on the entire array\n",
    "    quick_sort_recursive(0, len(arr) - 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage:\n",
    "arr = [10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]\n",
    "quick_sort(arr)\n",
    "print(\"Sorted array is:\", arr)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **quick_sort Function**:\n",
    "    - This is the main function that sets up and calls the recursive sort function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **partition Function**:\n",
    "    - This function is responsible for partitioning the array. It selects a pivot (in this case, the last element of the array).\n",
    "    - It then rearranges the array such that elements less than or equal to the pivot are on the left and elements greater than the pivot are on the right.\n",
    "    - Finally, it places the pivot in its correct position and returns its index.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **quick_sort_recursive Function**:\n",
    "    - This is the recursive function that applies Quick Sort to the subarrays.\n",
    "    - It checks if the current subarray has more than one element (`low < high`), and if so, it partitions the array and recursively applies Quick Sort to the subarrays formed by the partitioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding and using these main ideas and steps, you can implement Quick Sort to efficiently sort arrays in Python."
