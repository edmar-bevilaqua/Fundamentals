    "## Bubble Sort\n",
    "---\n",
    "Bubble sort is a simple and straightforward sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the list is sorted. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the main ideas behind bubble sort:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Ideas of Bubble Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comparison and Swap\n",
    "   - Compare each pair of adjacent elements.\n",
    "   - If the elements are in the wrong order (e.g., the first is greater than the second for ascending order), swap them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multiple Passes:\n",
    "   - The process of comparison and swapping is repeated for multiple passes.\n",
    "   - Each pass through the list places the next largest (or smallest, depending on the order) element in its correct position.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics of Bubble Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time Complexity\n",
    "  - Worst and average case: $O(n^2)$ (when the array is in reverse order).\n",
    "  - Best case: $O(n)$ (when the array is already sorted, with the optimized version).\n",
    "  - Bubble sort is generally not used for large datasets due to its inefficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Space Complexity\n",
    "  - $O(1)$ (in-place sorting).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stability\n",
    "  - Bubble sort is a stable sorting algorithm because it does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys."

    "Merge sort is a more advanced sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer paradigm. It divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the two sorted halves back together.\n",

    "#### Divide:\n",
    "   - Divide the unsorted list into two approximately equal halves.\n",

    "#### Conquer (Recursion):\n",
    "   - Recursively sort both halves. If the list has only one element, it is already sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Combine (Merge):\n",
    "   - Merge the two sorted halves into a single sorted list.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics of Merge Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time Complexity:\n",
    "  - Merge sort has a time complexity of $O(n \\log n)$ in all cases (worst, average, and best).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Space Complexity:\n",
    "  - The space complexity is $O(n)$ because of the extra space used for the temporary arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stability:\n",
    "  - Merge sort is a stable sorting algorithm, maintaining the relative order of equal elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",

    "  - Guarantees $O(n \\log n)$ time complexity.\n",
    "  - Stable sort.\n",

    "  - Requires additional memory for the temporary arrays.\n",
    "  - Not an in-place sort; the extra space complexity is $O(n)$.\n",

    "Merge sort is widely used for sorting linked lists and external sorting (e.g., when data is too large to fit into memory). It is also a preferred sorting algorithm in situations where stability is required."

As this study is merely for educational purposes (problably you will never need to really implement a sorting algorithm, because most languages has it implemented), I'll leave the above implementations as they are, as I don't see the need for optimizations for this Python Notebook."
